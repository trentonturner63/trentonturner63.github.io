            The Weather Channel was founded on July 18, 1980, by television meteorologist John Coleman
            (who had served as a chief meteorologist at ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago
            and as a forecaster for Good Morning America) and Frank Batten, then-president of the channel's
            original owner Landmark Communications (now Landmark Media Enterprises). The channel launched at
            8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 2, 1982. Originally, regional and local information was obtained
            from the National Weather Service for broadcast. Since 2002, all forecasting has been done on-site
            in Atlanta.

            The Weather Channel was a subsidiary of the Weather Company until the latter was bought by IBM in
            2016. The Weather Channel licenses its weather data from IBM.
